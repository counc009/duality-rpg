# Duality
A new TTRPG system for a unique magic system where magic is prevalent and either easy but weak or difficult but very powerful.

The `character/` directory contains a character builder for Duality.
The `latex/` directory contains the LaTeX sources for the core rules as well as several one-shots (for older versions of the system).
