\section{Advantages}
\textbf{Advantage}\index{Advantage} are meta-currency which represent power, preparation, luck, and other circumstances that may benefit the players or the GM.
Each Player can collect \Advantage, as can the GM.
\Advantage{} can be spent in a number of ways, detailed below and there may be other options that a GM allows or that are available based on particular creatures' abilities.
In general, players can spend their \Advantage{} to help other characters but their use should always make narrative sense; players should explain how they are narratively assisting and the GM may decide that a use of \Advantage{} is not possible given the circumstances.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Increasing a roll}: An \Advantage{} can be spent to \Increase{} a roll.
  \item \emph{Decreasing a roll}: An \Advantage{} can be spent to \Decrease{} a roll.
  \item \emph{Increase damage}: An \Advantage{} can be spent to increase the number of damage dice rolled by a creature by one.
  \item \emph{Decrease damage}: An \Advantage{} can be spent to reduce the number of damage dice rolled by a creature by one.
  \item \emph{Use an experience}: An \Advantage{} can be spent to add a character's \Experience{} to a relevant roll; Can only be spent to activate a character's own \Experience{} on their own roll.
\end{enumerate}
