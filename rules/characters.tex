\section{Character Statistics}
Characters are defined by their \emph{Attributes}, \emph{Specializations}, \emph{Experiences}, and \emph{Abilities}.
\emph{Attributes} define the character's broad statistics as well as their movement, wealth, and ability to take damage.
\emph{Specializations} define specific skills that the character possesses and the nature of those skills.
\emph{Experiences} reflect the character's past and offer bonuses to rolls in certain circumstances.
\emph{Abilities} provide unique mechanics for a character.

\subsection{Attributes}
Character \textbf{Attributes}\index{Attribute} represent the character's basic abilities.
Each character has four kinds of attributes that describe: their base statistics, their health, their movement abilities, and their wealth.

\subsubsection{Basic Statistics}
A character's basic statistics are defined by six \emph{Attributes}: \textbf{Strength}\index{Strength|see{Attribute}}, \textbf{Dexterity}\index{Dexterity|see{Attribute}}, \textbf{Willpower}\index{Willpower|see{Attribute}}, \textbf{Intelligence}\index{Intelligence|see{Attribute}}, \textbf{Wisdom}\index{Wisdom|see{Attribute}}, and \textbf{Charisma}\index{Charisma|see{Attribute}}.
These \emph{Attributes} each have a numeric value between $-1$ and $+2$ (for starting characters) and may increase to $+3$ when a character levels up.

These \Attribute{} values provide bonuses that are applied to rolls.
The GM should pick the \Attribute{} that makes most sense for the roll:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Strength}\index{Attribute!Strength}: A character's physical strength; their ability to lift, carry, climb, and so on.
  \item \textbf{Dexterity}\index{Attribute!Dexterity}: A character's manual dexterity; their ability to tie knots, move carefully and quietly, and so on.
  \item \textbf{Willpower}\index{Attribute!Willpower}: A character's will to live; this is used when a character is at risk of dying and can also be used in instances where luck is required.
  \item \textbf{Intelligence}\index{Attribute!Intelligence}: A character's book smarts; their ability to remember information, learn something new, break a code, and so on.
  \item \textbf{Wisdom}\index{Attribute!Wisdom}: A character's street smarts; their ability to analyze information and make plans, to understand deeper meaning, and so on.
  \item \textbf{Charisma}\index{Attribute!Charisma}: A character's person skills; their ability to talk and convince or deceive, to act, and so on.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Health}
There are three health related \emph{Attributes}: \textbf{Life}\index{Life|see{Attribute}}\index{Attribute!Life}, \textbf{Recovery}\index{Recovery|see{Attribute}}\index{Attribute!Recovery}, and \textbf{Block}\index{Block|see{Attribute}}\index{Attribute!Block}.
A creature's \Life{} defines how much damage it can it until it falls unconscious or dies.
Its \Recovery{} defines how much \Life{} a creature regains when it heals, rests, and recuperates.
\Block{} defines how much damage a creature can just absorb without any impact, as described later \Block{} is subtracted from damage dealt to a creature before subtracting the damage from its \Life.

A character's \emph{Maximum Life} has a numeric score between 1 and 40, its \Recovery{} a numeric score between 1 and 20, and its \Block{} a numeric score between 0 and 2.
Other creatures may have values outside of these ranges.

\subsubsection{Movement}
Each creature has a \textbf{Speed}\index{Speed|see{Attribute}}\index{Attribute!Speed} which determines how fast it moves and has \emph{Attributes} which determine by what means.
A creature's \emph{Speed} is one of \emph{Slow}, \emph{Normal}, and \emph{Fast} which abstractly define how quickly it can move.
Note that these speeds should be interpreted in the full context of a creature, a \emph{Slow} dragon may still fly faster than a \emph{Fast} snail or even mouse can move, though alternatively a \emph{Fast} dragon may still walk slower than a \emph{Normal} mouse can.

By default a creature's speed is its \emph{Walking} speed, but a creature may also be able \emph{Climb}, \emph{Burrow}, \emph{Swim}, and \emph{Fly}; each of these is its own \Attribute{} a character can posses which indicates whether it can move in that manner.

\subsubsection{Wealth}
The \textbf{Wealth}\index{Wealth|see{Attribute}}\index{Attribute!Wealth} \emph{Attribute} describes how much money a creature has and can easily spend.
Creatures with a high \emph{Wealth} are able to make larger purchases, without expending other meta-resources, than a creature with low \emph{Wealth}.
\emph{Wealth} has one of the values in Table~\ref{tab:wealth} which also describes the sorts of things that can be bought with that level.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline
    \textbf{Wealth Value} &\textbf{Example Purchases} \\ \hline
    None &nothing \\ \hline
    Wretched &basic food and lodging daily \\ \hline
    Squalid &basic (though sturdy) supplies like rope, arrows, and tents \\ \hline
    Modest &rare supplies like climbing equipment, a day of unskilled labor, a beast of burden \\ \hline
    Comfortable &a sailboat, a comfortable wagon, a day of skilled labor \\ \hline
    Luxurious &a mercenary, an abandoned warehouse or small property \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Wealth\index{Attribute!Wealth}}
  \label{tab:wealth}
\end{table}

\subsection{Specializations}
\textbf{Specializations}\index{Specialization} represent talents and abilities a creature has.
There are a total of sixty possible specializations, each described by the combination of a verb and noun and each character may possess a bonus associated with the specializations which can be used on relevant rolls and a \emph{tag} describing special mechanics for the character when they use that specialization.
The verbs and nouns that define \emph{Specializations} are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Verbs}: \emph{Control}, \emph{Create}, \emph{Destroy}, \emph{Perceive}, \emph{Know}, \emph{Transform}
  \item \textbf{Nouns}: \emph{Air}, \emph{Earth}, \emph{Fire}, \emph{Water}, \emph{Animals}, \emph{Plants}, \emph{Body}, \emph{Illusion}, \emph{Mind}, \emph{Arcana}
\end{itemize}
The bonus for each \Specialization{} can be $0$, $+1$, or $+2$ (for starting characters) and may increase up to $+4$ when a character levels up.

Each \Specialization{} has has an associated tag that specify the limits of the character's ability with that \Specialization.
These tags are:\index{Magic|see{Specialization}}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Human}\index{Specialization!Human}: the character can only perform within normal human ability.
  \item \textbf{Superhuman}\index{Specialization!Superhuman}: the character can perform within normal human ability easily ($-1$ \Difficulty) and can perform with superhuman ability (though within the laws of nature).
  \item \textbf{Simple \& Weak}\index{Specialization!Simple \& Weak}: the character can perform simple acts of magic easily ($-1$ \Difficulty) and can perform trivial acts of magic without a roll; the extent of the ability must be narrowly defined between the Player and GM.
  \item \textbf{Complex \& Powerful}\index{Specialization!Complex \& Powerful}: the character can perform complex acts of magic but any act of magic is difficult ($+1$ \Difficulty); the extent of the ability is widely defined and should be pushed to the limits. Failures on rolls to perform magic often result in magic gone awry.
\end{itemize}
In general, a tag cannot be changed after character creation unless the \Specialization{} only had a bonus of $+0$ and the \emph{Human} tag in which case the new tag represents learning a new ability.
The GM may allow changing tags in other situations as makes sense with the story.

\subsection{Experiences}
\emph{Experiences}\index{Experience} provide additional depth to a character by detailing parts of their past that may provide useful experience in circumstances they encounter in adventuring.
Each \Experience{} has a short, couple word, description and a bonus attached to; when a character is attempting something related to one of their \emph{Experiences} they may spend an \Advantage{} to activate it and add the \emph{Experience's} bonus to their roll.
Good experiences will be broad enough that there are a number of possible circumstances they could apply but they should not be able to apply in all circumstances.
Work with your GM and group to determine the appropriate breadth of \emph{Experiences} for your game and to decide when an \Experience{} applies.
The bonus associated with an \Experience{} is $+1$ or $+2$ for newly created characters and can be increased to $+3$ when a character levels up.

\subsection{Abilities}
Finally, \emph{Abilities}\index{Ability} provide additional unique mechanics for characters, generally to do with gaining or using \Advantage.
While not solely for non-magical characters, these \Ability{} are designed to assist non-magical builds by offering additional options for play and ways to gain \Advantage{} which allows the more use of \emph{Experiences}.
Below is a list of such abilities, along with their XP costs; players and GMs should feel free to build other \emph{Abilities} to match their desires.
Several of these abilities have a \emph{level} $n$ which, for example, impacts the number of \Advantage{} that a character gains; to take the ability you at first gain it at level 1 and can then spend the specified cost to increase it to level 2 and so on.
When acquiring an ability whose cost depends on $n$, you must spend XP based on the level ($n$) you are upgrading to, so \textbf{Take the Advantage} costs 2 XP for level 1, another 3 XP for level 2, and so on.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Take the Advantage} ($n + 1$ XP): At the beginning of each session, gain $n$ \Advantage.
  \item \textbf{Good Under Pressure} ($n + 1$ XP): Once per session, ask the GM how many \Advantage{} they have; if they have more than all Player Characters combined, gain $<n>$ \Advantage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Character Creation and Leveling-Up}
When creating a new character for a campaign, the GM should specify the number of \emph{Experience Points} (XP) that the players have to start with to build their characters.
A starting character (before spending any XP) has a $+0$ bonus for each of their basic statistics, a \Life{} of 20, a \Recovery{} of 10, a \Block{} of 0, a \emph{Speed} of \emph{Normal} (and only the ability to walk), and a bonus of $+0$ and the \emph{human} tag for all \emph{Specializations}.
A starting character also has one \emph{Item} whose construction does not cost XP beyond the cost of the \emph{Item} itself (see Section~\ref{sec:items} for details).
These statistics can be increased by spending XP, and in some cases decreased to gain XP, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To increase a basic statistic (to a maximum of $+2$) by $1$ costs $3 \times$ the score after the bonus; so increasing from $+0$ to $+1$ costs 3 XP, and from $+1$ to $+2$ costs 6.
    A basic statistic can also be decreased to $-1$ to gain 3 XP.
  \item To increase the character's Total \Life{} costs 1 XP for each point up to 30 Total \Life{} and then costs 2 XP for each point up to the maximum of 40.
    The Total \Life{} can also be decreased to gain XP, gaining 1 XP per point down to 20 and then 2 XP per point down to a minimum of 1.
  \item To increase the character's \Recovery{} costs 2 XP for each point up to 15 and then 4 XP for each point up to the maximum of 20.
    \Recovery{} can also be reduced to gain XP, gaining 2 XP for each point down to 5 and 4 XP for each point down to the minimum of 1.
  \item Increasing the character's \Block{} (up to a maximum of 2) costs $5 \times$ the new block; so a block of 1 costs 5 XP and increasing that to 2 costs 10 XP.
  \item A character's \Speed{} can be increased to \emph{Fast} for 2 XP or can be reduced to \emph{Slow} to gain 2 XP.
  \item To increase a \Specialization{} (up to a maximum of $+2$) bonus by $+1$ costs the score after the bonus; so increasing from $+0$ to $+1$ costs 1 XP and from $+1$ to $+2$ costs 2.
  \item To add a tag to a \Specialization{} (that only has the default \emph{human} tag costs the following:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Superhuman}: 3 XP
      \item \textbf{Simply \& Weak}: 2 XP
      \item \textbf{Complex \& Powerful}: 2 XP
    \end{itemize}
  \item To gain a $+1$ \Experience{} costs 1 XP and then increasing it (to a maximum of $+2$) by $1$ costs the score after the increase; so increasing a $+1$ experience to a $+2$ experience costs 2 XP.
  \item To gain an \Ability{}.
  \item To add additional features to their initial item or to construct additional items as described in Section~\ref{sec:items}.
\end{itemize}

Throughout their journeys, characters will also earn XP that they can use to improve their characters.
These may be spent in the same ways as above, but can also be spent to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increase a basic statistic to $+3$; cost is as described above.
  \item Increase a character's Total \Life{} beyond 40; the cost of each increase is one additional XP for each 10 points, so each point up to 50 costs 3 XP, up to 60 costs 4 XP, and so on.
  \item Increase a character's \Recovery{} beyond 20; the cost of each increase is two additional XP for each 5 points, so each point up to 25 costs 6 XP, up to 30 costs 8 XP, and so on.
  \item Increase a character's \Block{} up to 5; cost is as described above.
  \item Increase a \Specialization{} bonus up to $+4$; cost is as described above.
  \item Increase an \Experience{} bonus up to $+3$; cost is as described above.
\end{itemize}
