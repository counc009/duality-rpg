\section{Advantages}
\textbf{Advantage}\index{Advantage} are meta-currency which represent power, preparation, luck, and other circumstances that may benefit the players or the GM.
Each Player can collect \Advantage, as can the GM.
\Advantage{} can be spent in a number of ways, detailed below and there may be other options that a GM allows or that are available based on particular creatures' abilities.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Increasing a roll}: An \Advantage{} can be spent to \Increase{} a roll; this does not need to be a roll by the person spending the \Advantage{} though their character must be able to narratively aid in the situation.
  \item \emph{Decreasing a roll}: An \Advantage{} can be spent to \Decrease{} a roll; a Player's character must be able to narratively disrupt the roll to use \Advantage{} in this way.
  \item \emph{Increase damage}: An \Advantage{} can be spent to increase the number of damage dice rolled by a creature by one; the damage roll does not need to be by the person spending the \Advantage{} though their character must be able to narratively impact the situation.
  \item \emph{Decrease damage}: An \Advantage{} can be spent to reduce the number of damage dice rolled by a creature by one; a Player's character must be able to narratively impact the situation to use \Advantage{} in this way.
\end{enumerate}
